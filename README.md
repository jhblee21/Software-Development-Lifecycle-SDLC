# Software-Development-Lifecycle-SDLC

## Project Description
This project is the Sprint Review and Retrospective artifact for a fictional software development project that was developed using Scrum-Agile methodology as part of the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) course at Southern New Hampshire University. This artifact reflects on the various aspects and phases of the SDLC, as well as the team roles of the Scrum-Agile methodology by answering the following questions:

* How did the various roles on the Scrum-agile Team specifically contribute to the success of the SNHU Travel project?
* How did a Scrum-agile approach to the SDLC help each of the user stories come to completion?
* How did a Scrum-agile approach support project completion when the project was interrupted and changed direction?
* Provide samples of my communications that demonstrate my ability to communicate with my team effectively?
* What organizational tools and Scrum-agile principles helped my team be successful?
* Pros and cons of the Scrum-agile approach for the SNHU Travel project
* Determine whether or not a Scrum-agile approach was the best approach for the SNHU Travel development project

## Wrap-up Questions
### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The needs of the users should be conveyed directly from the users in a face-to-face (preferred) or virtual meeting with the Product Owner. This way, the Product Owner can hear from the user in their own words who needs something accomplished, what they want to accomplish, and why they want to do it. The Product Owner can then develop user stories based on the user needs by documenting an informal description of the features to be developed. Doing this helps the Product Owner and the rest of the Scrum Team identify the specific feature that needs to be developed that will bring value to the user. 

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
